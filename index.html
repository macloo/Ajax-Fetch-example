<h1>Ajax and Fetch Examples</h1>

<p>Ajax enables us to communicate with the server, access a file or a database there, and come back to our page and alter its contents <em>without reloading the page</em>. Often Ajax is also used to send data from the page (often from a form) to a script on the server, and often the server-side script will then access a database.</p>

<p>Here is an example <a href="ajax_example.html">using Ajax to get data out of a file on the server</a>.</p>

<p>Ajax is probably going to be replaced by <strong>Fetch</strong> in the near future. Here is the same example <a href="fetch_example.html">done with Fetch instead of Ajax</a>.</p>
